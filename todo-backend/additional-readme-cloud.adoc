=== Environment variables for PostgreSQL

The Helm Chart also contains the environment variables required to connect to the PostgreSQL database.

ifndef::ProductRelease[]
In local deployment the credentials were passed directly as the values of the environment variables.
endif::[]

For {additional-readme-cloud-platform}, we rely on secrets so that the credentials are never copied outside {additional-readme-cloud-platform}:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
deploy:
  env:
    - name: POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD
        - name: POSTGRESQL_DATABASE
          valueFrom:
            configMapKeyRef:
              name: postgres-configmap
              key: POSTGRES_PASSWORD
----

When the application is deployed, the value for the `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD` will be taken from the key `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
in the secret `postgres-configmap`.

== Use the todobackend Web Frontend

Once the backend is deployed on {additional-readme-cloud-platform}, it can be accessed from the route `todo-backend`.
Let's find the host that we can use to connect to this backend:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ oc get route todo-backend -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}"
todo-backend-jmesnil1-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

This value will be different for every installation of the backend.

To be able to connect to the backend from the ToDo Backend Specs or Client, then prepend the host with `https://`, and append the relative web context `/todo-backend`. For the previous example host this would be `https://todo-backend-jmesnil1-dev.apps.sandbox.x8i5.p1.openshiftapps.com/todo-backend`.

We can verify that this application is properly working as a ToDo Backend by running its https://todobackend.com/specs/index.html[specs] on it.

Once all tests passed, we can use the https://todobackend.com/client/index.html[todobackend client] to have a Web application connected to the backend.

[NOTE]
====
https://todobackend.com/[todobackend.com] is an external service used to showcase this quickstart.
It might not always be functional but does not impact the availability of this backend.

== Clean Up

=== Remove the Backend

The backend can be deleted from {additional-readme-cloud-platform} by running the command:

[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ helm uninstall todo-backend
release "todo-backend" uninstalled
----
